## Background

Hello! 

My name is Vishvajit Kumbhar and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. I did my undergraduate at P.V.P.I.T. Sangli, India where I majored in Mechanical Engineering. as well as I completed my post-graduation in Industrail Engineering and Management at National Institute of Technology, Calicut India. In my postgraduate studies I studied about Machin learning and Deep learning and completed two thesis on above mentioned projects. 

Now I focus on programming for whatever problems come my way, automating my life wherever I can and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
