## Overview
This is a React web app which predicts account transaction.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.9.4. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
## Deployement on Heroku and Netlify
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.
the fastapi backend is deployed on heroku with [heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) cli (see the documentation for process) and the React frontend is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
