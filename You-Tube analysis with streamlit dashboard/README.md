## Overview 
I go through and build a dashboard using ken jee's YouTube data that you can expand upon to share in your portfolio. In this project, the analysis of his youtube video performance is done.

For the Analysis base line metrics are calculated such as subscriber gain, number of views, like etc. by using his last year performance and compared to his last six month performance to gain insight.
