8,"The phone is compact and can be used with a single hand Camera is average, pictures are over saturated and colour reproduction is simply inaccurate,Big problem with Realme phones I guess.A bit disappointed. (iqoo7 and one plus Nord 2 both have better camara and display quality)At this price point I feel it's a bit underwhelming.The design of the phone is definitely a key highlightdisplay is suboptimal with mono speakers, so maybe reconsider that before buying Overall a decent product."

18,Battery lo  good charger very fast best handy phone
19,"I duno why they say the battery is average of this phone . I think is so good. It doesn't feels like it's only 4.3k mah, it's more than that. Today is my 1 month of  using this phone . I'm pretty much happy with this device . I'm getting 8-9 hours of screen on time , if you use it hardcore , like gaming and stuff for continually you'll get approximately about 5-6 hours screen on time , it only requires 30 minutes to get fully charged bang ! Happy user üòä"

22,"Pros :1. Snapdragon 778G is a powerful and battery efficient chipset. You can rely on it blindly for the next 3 years.2. 120Hz SuperAmoled display. The display is really mesmerizing.3. Realme UI gives one of the best software experience. No lag, no stutters. Most of the bloatware on Realme UI can be uninstalled. MIUI is full of bugs, bloatware and ads these days. MIUI is the main reason I cancelled my Xioami 11i order.4. The in-box cover is excellent. You'll love it!5. Signal reception a..."

24,1 bought this phone one month ago performace was very well absolutely good display but I should say one thing the display is not durable my phone fell from my waist height and the display is broken. now I think everyone should change the pre-installed screencard as soon as possible if I had done it wouldn't have happened and my last phone was realme 3 pro it had a better durable display compared to realme gt me I could only imagine how many times it fell from my hand and nothing happend till ...
25,"Pros:-1.Display is best in class and outdoor visibility is also best.2. Design language is also best voyager grey colour is unique and design is like a suitcase type.3.

It's support 4g+, it's a great feature like carrier aggregation better network stability.6. I am not gamer but install NFS and its plays like butter no lags or frame drop found till .7. ..."
26,Master edition is just for a name. Not the best phone of realme brand. Don't rush to buy this product. Not worthy of spending 25k+.Battery charging fast and battery drain very fast.Hope of the product high.but actually product poor .Phone almost feels like ticking all the boxes but in actual it's not the case.Phone design is good.
27,"Got this mobile on a nice deal in BB day. First I had slight hesitation in buying realme mobile for a huge price,but the deal was irresistable hence decided to go for it, Camera- One of the best in market for natural light environment at this price.Performance- Top notch, butter smooth in the price range.Battery- Very quick ,though 4k mah ,not much to worry coz of 65W charger.Speaker- Though single speaker, loud enogh.Other positivesLook and feelUI optimization featuresFlip sidesPr..."
28,"I got this realme GT me in 14.5k with exchange offer. the performance is top notch in that price.pros : great display with true color, 360hz touch sampling rate, good in gaming.cons: build quality is not good, side frame got scratches with a small fall from my hand, but screen didn't get scratch at all, camera quality is not good. realme 8 and realme GT me has same camera setup but skin tone is not good, focus hunting in video mode.carrier aggregation is not there , it cannot use multiple ..."
29,Camera- best camera in this range better than OnePlus nord 2 .Performance-nodoubt outstanding performance this 778G chipset no lag in BGMI i play everyday 5-6 hr.Battery- okay okay 65 watt charger doesn't feel .Display-emmersive display 120hrtz screen feel that premium ness.I Like Realme Smartphone UI its better than XiaomiBuilt Quality also good
30,The Display is not that bright üåûüòé but Processor is good .it's is very stable . If you got this phone in a good deal or in sale than go for it or buy latest Neo 2 . Camera can be improved I'm really disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è .1. Light weight and Handy enough you'll enjoy while using .
31,"After 15days use phone was very good , only con is battery life they can fix this in an update. Other things like camera, display, performance are very good at this price point (I bought in BBD's) I like the most is the display and fast charging ,5% to 100% just 30mins to charge very good.... Except battery,I love everything in phone... I'll give 4/5 rating overall, because of battery I gave 4/5."
32,"Everything is going good ,but suddenly while typing the keypad, it suddenly goes back without clicking back button, noticed this rarely but in a model like this realme should take care of this bugs,camera is okay, gaming is super cool,battery is again okay, performance wise it's premium."
33,Really a very osm Device at this price range..Osm camera elegant design & features... it's such a light weight...the camera is so clear & working smoothly....I loved it.. thank uhh Flipkart ü•∞ü•∞
34,Best in quality and price in this range..till now it is working fine and performance is good and  upto the mark....i will  definitelyrecommend  this real me  phone..
35,"If you have got millions buy Apple Samsung Oneplus for 50k or 1L but if you are not brand centric this beauty is for you....I am not full time gamer but I do play games....I am a good photographer (not professional though) but must tell you it is difficult to beat its performence, Processor, Display,Battery, Camera, huge Internal storgae, good RAM management, believe you me do whatever you want with this phone you will not find any dearth."
36,The mobile was very good but firstly give fast updates and there was a camera problem the colour very low light make the camera a bit bright the display is a bit yellowish make it normal by updates and lastly the processor is very good Charing Speed is next level 0-100 full charge in 30 mins give updates first and make the camera and display issue fix and mobile is very good with its unik design
37,Phone is very handy.had some bloatware but it can be uninstalled.camera is very impressive I compared it with my OnePlus 9r nd it was really better than 9r.close shots and night mode were better in op but other images very good in GT
38,"Pros:1. In-hand feel superb & lite weight, compact too2. No issues in performance3. Decent display & Decent cameras4. Good built quality5. Full charge in just 30minCons:1. No dual speakers but single speaker loud enough2. No Dolby Atmos support but supports hi-res audio"
39,I'm Very Happy and Satisfy for This Compact Great Product
40,"1. First of all camera performance is not upto the mark. Camera's  performance in low light is very bad, i have my old device ( realme 3 pro ) which is far better than this device even after 2.5 years.2. Battery performance is also not upto mark it can give upto 6-7 hours of backup. But good think is that you get 65 w superdart charger in the box.3. No complain about the display quality and the stunning look of the device.4. If you are looking for a device in range 26-28k go for realme ..."
41,Pros..1. Very Handy to hold for long time2. Premium look3. Awesome display4. Face recognition & fingerprint are accurate5. No lagging at all6. 30 min super fast chargingCons..1. Average Cameras both rear and front at this price segment2. Charging life is low but covered with 65W Charge3. Minor heating issue while chargingOverall it's Ok but not the MASTERGood deal if you get @ 16k
42,"Review based on 10 days usages :- Camera is awesome , good pixel clarity Battery is ok ok but charging is very fast so it is manageableBecause of 8 GB RAM , NO lagging during app switching Look wise it's trendy and gripping is good All together good phone in 20k+ range"
43,"Camera back side third class like 5thosands phone ,front camera ok,display 4/5,Camera front 4/5and back 1/5, battery backup 3/5, battery charging 5/5,Sound through Speaker 3/5,sound through headphone 4/5,lag in this phone even if my moto 20 fusion normal application open quickly  than it,and moto software experience is awesome,even back cam  photo in moto is not good but sharp and far better compare to it ,it's back  cam photo is too soft."
44,"Performance-wise phone is stable SD 778 does its job perfectly for your daily activities, I don't know about gaming performance since I never play games on phones.Battery life is decent it lasts for a typical day but this won't bother you since the charging is super cool fast.Look Wise phone is pretty premium.I got this with a very good exchange offer so bought it otherwise would never have got it considering another option by paying just 2k extra which is Nord 2."

46,Better than Realme 7pro/8pro atleast in terms of:PerformanceBatteryScreen sizeRefresh rateFront camera is a huge disappointment.Rear camera is good enough but this can't be camera mobile.Not good for heavy Gamer.
47,Camera is not very good.Battery is just impressive.Display one of the best in this price segment.Charging speed is beast.Although a good buy in this price segment if you are not looking for the very good camera.
48,"1.Performance- Everything is fluid and multi tasking is done very easily. All types of games can be played with good graphics settings.2.Display- It is the most talking point of the mobile and it lives upto the expectation, colours are vibrant brightness is good 120hz panel is very smooth in animations.3.Battery- Battery is on the okish side it would definitely last one day with Normal usage, with heavy gaming and entertainment you would have to charge it in between.Best thing is you get ..."
49,"Disappointing.I have been an Android user for almost 11 years now. Have used the following brands - Samsung, Micromax, Honor, Xiaomi and Realme before this phone. I generally don't repeat brands and this was the  first time I repeated a brand due to the excellent performance of my previous realme phone (pro 3). That phone was fast and worked flawlessly over 30 months. Even at 30 months it was giving 24 hours battery backup. I don't play energy intensive games or watch long videos. Apart from..."
50,Its a fantastic mind blowing phone Zing zing amazing Wonderfu magic in this phone Very very reasonable 5g phone
51,Excellent phone.Battery is bit less i.e. 4300mah.Front camera is good but not giving  32mp experience performance.Rear camera is too good.Design & Look is premium.Back cover given in box is too sexy.Great features like NFC makes life easier for Debit/Credit card use.
52,"If you can get it around 20-21k it's a very good deal.I watched geekyranjit sir's review and bought this one.Best in the price range. Used redmi note 7 pros for 3 years before buying this and I can say realme UI >>>>> MIUI.As of now, I can say there are no bugs in here. And it's a very lightweight UI.I don't use the camera much but I can say it's capturing great pics. Played BGMI at the highest graphics and there was no lag at all, the gameplay was smooth. Though I am not a heavy gamer.T..."
53,"Heating issues, battery üîã back not good but quick change is very effective , only in 35 minutes Full charge, Camera nice but not as per my expectationsBetter to go for One plus Nord."
54,"Best product ... Excellent camera, great performance, battery drains fast... But not worry 65w super dart charge full in 35 min. Approximately.. nice design...Handy phone."
55,"This phone is a super fast phone and very light phone and perfectly fits on our hand. Only disappointed is on the speakers, this phone doesnt have stereo speakers or dolby atmos support.Otherwise the phone is super smooth and very fast phone."
56,"1. Camera is Decent. (Both front and rear).2. Battery efficiency is great as compared to 4300mah.(65 watt charger in box is really fast, charge just in 30-35 mins)3. Screen quality really good. Peak brightness 1000 nits really feels in sunny day.4. SD778G is battery efficient and performance wise is also great.5. Device is really feels very light and thin. (gives premium experience)."
57,I am using this phone from one week it's running smoothly without any lag. Display is also good. Front camera is good in daylight and rear camera is average. In low light regular image is full of grains. In night mode it gets improved but over all camera performance is average. I am getting 1 day battery backup easily with moderate usage no gaming only calls and watching videos. If you want phone with good performance and display you can buy this phone. Do not buy if you want good camera.
58,Pros1. Display quite good.2.Light weight.3.Processing ability is good.I m not a gamer.4.Decent Camera.Cons1.Battery back up is avg.Lasts 12 hrs for standard user.2. Gray back cover provided by realme for black coloured GT master is pathetic.Quality not upto d mark.3.Back design is not available for black model.I think it's available for gray model only.4.I ve upgraded from realme 3 pro to GT master.believe me realme 3 pro is a far better device than this...many more features than GT ...
59,"I don't know why people are talking crazy for lack of battery life, for a guy like me using it whole day to call, office teams meating, checking and forwarding mail, listening music and watching videos on utube, Still at the end of day 30% battery still remains after full charging every morning,Go for it guys, it's a good one to have."
60,If this phone will come under 18thousand then it will be good the price is high for this specifications battery is not good
61,Realme GT master  monster phone....... Looking very  awesome

63,"Bought this beautiful phone in Diwali Sale (Voyager Grey, 8+256 GB) after lots of research and reviews over internet.It is really a wonderful and power packed phone. Best phone in this price range. Everything is as expected. Display, Camera, Sound, Battery backup, processor and the Realme UI is just awesome. üëåüèªThe suitcase design is very attractive and eye catching. üòçOverall the phone is a fully value for money product. In love with it. üíï"
64,"1. BATTERY- Battery Charging and Withstanding hours are Just awesome. 2. CAMERA- Clarity of camera awesome3. WEIGHT- Light weight4. FEATURES- More features. My previous is poco X2 , more features in REALME UI more than Mi UI. Customisation can done as per your need. 5. In offer I get this for 25,000 - worth for money64mp - LeavesSelfie Potrait - Wall sticker"
65,"Great phone to buy under 20k. Great performace, camera, display. Two things which could be better are: speaker (no dual speaker), battery performance (drain very quickly, cannot expect to last more than 12 hours with GPS on)Xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g is too similar, both based on snapdragon 778g chipset. That had some advantage of slimmer size, better display, dual speaker, but lacked in terms of refresh rate.Go for anyone of these if priced below 20k."
66,Camera is good and also battery is ok for daily averge use. Performance is good and good rigidity. Display very good. Audio quality not stereo type in headset and not good like Samsung or other premium phones. Sound quality with headset is dull.
67,Sleek stylish handy Truly MasterDesign is awesome. Performance is good.Overall a good phone in this price range.
68,Phone is amazing but if u want to buy it so go for X7 max X7 max is far better than gt master
69,Here are the problems that I have faced1.The delivery took too long almost 12 days and it's the first time I'm getting something so late.2. Battery is meh. It charges really fast so you probably won't find it that much of a problem. It drains for no reason. Also the phone heats up a lot while charging.3. Touch is not the best. It is responsive but not as good as I thought.The Oled looks great though.
70,"I am writing this review after using it for one month. Certainly I am liking it. But there are pros and cons.Pros-1. Screen quality is awesome, brighter and viewing experience is good.2. 120hz display, love to scroll.3. Processor is really good. Gaming experience is nice.4. Lite weight. In-hand feel is nice.5. Selfie camera is good.6. 65w charger. Complete charging in 33 mins. 7. Most of the Google apps can be used as primary apps.Cons-1. Too much bloatwares. First mobile in which..."
71,I bought in the sale at a very descent rate and was good at that price . I won't recommend you this phone at this price as it is not performing like 30k . But it is good at 24k . Overall the features are good. I bought it 15 days ago and till now I have good experience with this phone.

73,"Design is pretty good and light weight mobile.Processor is also nice for normal users who uses camera and social medias and browsing.For gaming it's good only but my suggestion is to go with Snapdragon 870 or more for better smooth experience.Now coming to camera it's not that much what they say.very poor camera experience in recent smartphones.It is clear when u take pic in both front and back cameras but when you zoom it,you will really hate it.They say it has 64megapixel back cameras a..."
74,Good mobile but I expected still more coming into the display and processor . overall good experience I got for lower price with smart upgrade and exchange.. nearly 10k
75,"It's Smooth Glider. If you are upgrading to this device after 60hz IPS display. First month you will never give it rest.30 min ful charge, all day backup. On realme 3.0 they work seperately on 'Smooth engine' make even smoother.If you are looking for upgrading or you are under budget. I suggest you make your budget and buy it , rather than buy any under budget normal device.As it named Master Edition they mean it.üî•"
76,"Good and smart phone but battery drain fast is a one issue with this phone, need good battery backup others wise good phone"
77,"Worth for money, smooth and silky. Very compact in size and excellent camera. Battery backup for one day when we use hotspot for 9hrs. Getting heat when we use mobile data eventhough hotspot is off. Overall very good model in realme. I love it."
78,Suppar phone valu per money good camara good speed and good batary and amazing future
79,"What is expected from a flagship Product, is missing.Mainly, the battery does not support even 20 hours for normal usage. Fast charging is available but you cannot charge every 10 hours.Camera is good. This feature is as anticipated. Both front and back camera.Design is awesome.All is all, good budget phone but not capable to make a flagship product.""Realme"" has already set the standards up  in mobile phone segment.. So,  it's obvious that customers expect a good product always."
80,It's pure value for money product.Pros:1)It's superdart charger full charge mobile in 25-30 min max.2) amoled display gives crisp & clear videos3)super smooth operation.4)good bettery back up- when I was using 4000 MAH battery it hardly last for 1 day. This phone gives 1 and half day bettry.5) photo's are good not best.6) This phone is very slim.7) no heating issue.Cons:Pre-installed many least required apps( you can remove it manualy).Go for it.
81,Everything is good. But Battery is not soo good but yeah charging is super fast and also camera is good in light but at night its just worst. Performance is awesome and heats very less compared to other phone of this price range except while charging.
82,Realy awesome phone  Good gpu and cpu management. Good camera. Overall an awesome phone.
83,"Review after using 20 daysDesign and display quality is pretty good.Battery drains so fast.Really disappointed with camera quality . As per phone specifications Realme say back camera 64 mp but it works as 8mp, front camera is 32 mp but works as 8 mp . When you zoom the picture it shows no detail about the picture. Camera quality is worst above the 10k mobile range phone. My old honor 8x camera is much better than this 29k mobile. Real me needs to work on this 29k mobile camera  updation ..."
84,"One day late delivered my item, I think mobile was missing in this time,,, but received right mobile and I checked everything working fine,,,,,... But Flipkart cc team not helping properly, ... Any way mobile is very good and best price in bbday sales"
85,"COMPLETELY WASTE OF MONEYCons:- Worst battery life,            Below average camera performance,Pros:-Good display,           Fast charging,           Software performance is better than MIUIRecommendation:- do not purchase.However,if     you can get this at lowest price only then you should consider this otherwise it wil disappointing in terms of camera and battery life ,if you pay 25k or more than that, because this phone only deserve 20k to 21k price tag"
86,Battery is worst and draining in 6 hours Not a valuable purchase Request for replacement 3-4 times but everytime issues not resolved
87,Bad quality
88,Not like janun product
89,"The best phone under 25 k provides good display, performance,decent camera look.Also if you are not heavy user then you will get one day battery backup without any problem.Just haptic feedback is not that good.In camera starry mode is also a good features like in pixel provides their phone"
90,The smartphone is really good and i got it for 14k as i have made an exchange.The exchange and all went well and device is ideal for anyone looking for a better cam and display.Mid range gaming performance also.
91,First of all it had call recorder but it indicates that your call has been recorded. I face a major problem that it has automatically came on do not disturb mode without selecting and schedule which disturb a lot. Battery backup is very good. camera quality is very good.
92,If u want a mobile for  non gaming and smooth performance den go for it...its value for money..if u can afford some more money den go for gt neo 2...

U people wil get tired ..bcz anywhere u go u just want to put ur mobile charge this is my problem now"
164,"Useless mobile, did not like it at all, it heats up, not worth  32k, even with a discount on big billion days 23k is useless too. My son's 2 years old Honor 20i with 12k beats this model so easily. I did go with realme as my other family member had it, but this time, this model is worthless for sure. Not sure what is the premium features this has to cost so much.Heating is a too bad sign. The battery drains too fast too, not more than 12 hours."
165,Clearly picture and camera take natural picture. Overall good phone.
166,Good
167,Waste of money
168,"Reviewing after 1 week usage, got this in BBD sale for 19k after exchange and bank offers.For 19k it brings value for money, feels premium.Display is good with 1000 nits peak brightness.Leather back is quite a unique designIn hand feel is good. Some bloatware notifications are being pushed out by realme apps but can be easily disabled with tweaks in settings. Night mode is good.100% charged in 33 mins thanks to 65w superdart charger."

310,Dont buy this phone. Got my phone delivered but microphone was working only sometimes. Got replacement and again I am facing the same issue. Absolute piece of junk it is.
311,Very bad phone doesn't buy the product
312,Please don't buy this phone if you're moderate user because battery backup is very poor. Screen on time on full charge is only 4 hours considering the price point doesn't make sense.Don't know why realme is selling this phone without proper testing of device. They have tried to make light weight design by reducing the battery capacity and dividing battery into two parts for faster charging but reducing overall backup.
313,"In this price range Auto all call recording option not availableTwo options only, not in contact and selected contact.I have 1000+ contact and selection process is one by one. Wrost experienceDon't buy this phone, if you have necessity of all call recording option."

My view is spending for this mobile is waste.

570,I changed my sim Vodafone to Jio... And now Airtel. But now I realised problem in this mobile phone. Same problem continues till today. Problem is... Call disconnect while talking or muted... We hear opposite voice but our voice muted without mute on.... Bad experience...

It took hardly 35 to 40 mins to get full charge.2. Look is superb !! Without cover is so slim and handy . 3. Performance wise, there is no lag not yet.4. Camera- in case of photos, not enough good it's average but in videography, it's so fine and stable."
607,Good
608,Camera quality should be better Easily draining battery Not upto mark in 27000

614,Although mobile is quite good but it is very hard to find perfect mobile cover. I'm trying to find shockproof cover from past 1 week but failed to find.Install Google camera which captures more natural and better photos. Although battery capacity is slightly low but with superdart charger it charges full within 30 months from 0% to 100% which is awesome.

For normal use battery last for one day but for heavy gaming it drains within 4 to 6 hrs , but again 65W superdart covers this. Ultra light weight phone which gives a premium feel . So, concluding the review if you are a heavy gamer go for gt neo 2 else if you are a normal user then go ahead with this nice phone. Thanks!!"

1431,"Writing almost after using 20daysPhone is marvelous, charging is blazing fast...loved the performance.Except 3 cons. Phone is best in every expect1. Bloatware, 2. Battery (if you are a heavy user, but not to worry it has lightning fast changing)3. Camera (camera is overall good but not up to mark)Sugg-‚úìIf camera is your priority then go for Samsung...‚úìIf you have a serious issue with bloatware leave it, because there is no option to disable bloatware app."

Won't suggest for gaming .Camera is damn good at this price segment .Charging is good but drains too fast , need some updates . Bugs are still there which can not be turned off .

1547,"Mobile is so good.camera, battery performance are also good.But the price is a bit high."
1548,It's one problem is that it should have stereo speakers while it has only mono speaker apart from that the performance should be lil bit better than that in this price range.But this phone is amazing really a master in every aspect except speakers which more than sufficient but if they would have given stereo speakers then it was way better . Thanks

1554,Every thing good but price so high
1555,Fantastic Pho
1556,I have purchased this item on BBD. Initially Camera quality was not upto mark but recent update it has been improved a lot. We have to compromise little bit regarding battery performance but 65W charging is the best thing with it. It is not Corning Gorilla glass in it as the protection which should be there as it is costly phone otherwise product it very good. I haven't faced any kind of lagging .I am satisfied with it.

1566,"Average phone, disappointing camera performance, camera hung for night pictures, average battery life with fast changing."

1598,Everything is Fine in this phone but only drawback is Camera performance.If you're looking for a good camera phone then dont go with realme Gt at all .Battery -  draining Fast in 120Hz screen. In 60Hz its ok.

1604,Disappointed with Camera performance.very poor quality
1605,My review after using it for a month:Pros:1. Excellent performance. No lagging or slow.2. Excellent display.Cons:Battery is very poor comparing the price and market demand. They should do something about it. My 3 years old phone has same battery backup time as this mobile.
1606,"Awesome performance, fantastic display and more. Overall, a good phone.Got best exchange value for my Redmi 4 (4, 64GB) i.e. 9500.Attached are some camera samples in the evening time. Great shot and photo quality in both main sensor as well as ultrawide sensor."

1625,"Nice phone in this price range. Fast charging , RAM, and screen response rate are positive points.  Camera is great in day light condition. AI function works well. Night captures are not up to the mark. Few features should have been added as, owners customized wallpapers (which can consist of multiple pictures from phone memory) , dial display (current display is simple white) . One more drawback which needs to be worked upon is, announcement which happens when we start to record a call...."

1652,Excellent performance
1653,Camera quality and other options features are missing.OIS missing.lot of unnecessary apps by realme. Annoying web browser. Would consider value for money if price is around 20 to 22k. Even updates are not so fast. Still realme ui 3.0 is not there.
1654,Evevery thing is ok need more battery power
1655,Overall performance is good. Sound  quality need to improve üòú
1656,A good device if priced at 20k coz you have an average camera. You can consider Motorola mobiles in this price range which has an ad-free experience as it runs stock software and also has ThinkShield security built in.

It comes around 7-7.5 rough hours, and you cannot charge the phone without your 65W charger (power banks charges very slowly) The overall performance is excellent and the display is also great. Camera is also good. Good choice to buy if you are not a heavy user or if you are comfortable to charge your phone twice a day. It takes 30 mins to go from 0% to 100%. Will update if I find anything else."
1744,After 6000 discount it's best in this price range. Battery and camera could be better but no complaints. Fast charger is amazing.
1745,Okay
1746,Ok
1747,"Superb..... everything is amazing.Only call recording is the one I'm missing in this phone, third party app does work but it's not up to mark. Apart from this it's amazing....5/5 ‚≠ê"
1748,Nice phone low budget nice performance
1749,"An awesome machine ... It's literally a powerhouse that is go on on and on .. camera fabulous, super amoled display is awesome, storage oh my god I can also fit in to that storage... Battery performance is not upto to mark although it is only 4300 mah... But it's ok... This phone has a lot of features inside it, you will amazed to explore one after another..."
1750,Nice
1751,"Camera good, performance good,Battery discharge very quickly hardly stands for 5-6 hrs even actual use of Max 3-4 hrs.Slim and light weight mobile.Call disconnects frequently.Overall for those normal phone users this phone is good not for the Gamers."
1752,Good
1753,It's lagging too much I buy the 8 256gb varient it's fingerprint doesn't work properly after the return policy over also it's hanging very much
1754,"Excellent mobile overall, but has compromise on its battery life which is balanced by a superfast charger 65 w"
1755,Best phone in this price range but battery could have been better but still it is a practical mid ranger
1756,Mobile is defective and the tough screen not working and battery draining very much and hanging problem and finger print not working don't buys
1757,Over priced mobile fit in 15-20 k. If you need for camera performance then go for samsung A series and S series. Display is not up to mark as samsung Samoled. Performance is good. Display operation is smooth.
1758,Superb mobile
1759,Picture nice focus slow
1760,Camera is good and performance more than expected but battery doesn't stay more than 15hrs. Every morning need to charge but 100% charged in 20 mins.
1761,Good phone under 25 k
1762,"Have been using it for the past 2-3 weeks. The display is awesome and the performance is great too. The only drawback is the battery backup - even after normal usage, battery drains out faster than expected. Need to charge the phone everyday.Overall love the phone, worth buying."
1763,Soo cool üòé
1764,Average phone with high price . Actually on discounted rate is actual price .
1765,Battery is getting drained in half day you have to charge twice a day because 4300 mah battery only plus point is it will get charged to 100% in 30 min. Camera is not that good but okay performance is awesome. good light weight and premium look and feel smart phone.
1766,Worth to buy this item.

1771,"Awesome phone in this price segment. Can be called midrange flagship. This phone charges like hell, 90% in just 10 minutes. Amoled display, 64 mp omnivison sensor, 4300 mah battery with dash charge, 256gb/8gb varient with snapdragon 778 is enough future proof for atleast 3 years. But my review is just suggestion, do your own research before buying."

1798,Review after 3 Months of use:Performance wise it's very good. Really didn't faced any lag while multi-tasking even if so many apps are opened in background. Only issue I am facing sometimes maybe due to memory overload is that it sometimes gets automatically locked with display blackout for a while when memory usage gets very high and needs to be unlocked again. This is the weird thing I noticed because It really didn't hangs but only this thing happens!Camera I would say is good not the ...

1912,There is some issue with the battery here.Mobile is draining battery faster than expected. Its mostly when phone is on standby. Even after disabling always on display the phone is draining 1-2 percent every hour.Realme should be able to fix this with a software update but they are lagging behind.For the last 3 years I was using realme 2 pro and never faced any problem so bought realme again (even after knowing that it has tons of bloatware) but now feeling disappointed

Phone remains hot until u keep aside after charging for 5-10 mins..Advantage is its charging time.. It charges phone very quickly and doesn't drain fast... Not sure how many days its life would be as it gets hot in every charge..
2112,Very good mobile in this price.
2113,Awesome phone.super fast ...
2114,"Amazing phone fast charger , amazing camera , amazing battery ,gaming experience is also good and display is very good"
2115,Why I am regretting- 1. Battery less than than 6 hours screen on time.2. Storage not expandable.3. Lack of dual speakers cause sound to be suppressed by hand often.Why I bought it-1. Leather finish non slippery unique design back panel.2. Battery charges in half hour.3. Slim.4. I got it at 19.5k in big billion days. Realme 8s would have been better at less price.
2116,Good experience

2139,I am using this phone from one week it's running smoothly without any lag. Display is also good. Front camera is good in daylight and rear camera is average. In low light regular image is full of grains. In night mode it gets improved but over all camera performance is average. I am getting 1 day battery backup easily with moderate usage no gaming only calls and watching videos. If you want phone with good performance and display you can buy this phone. Do not buy if you want good camera.

Those who are looking for big battery life, this is absolutely not for you. Gameing experience is lovely no issues. Front camera is good only in Day light."

2909,"Simply super.. light weight,good camera,good view"
2910,The worst thing after using 1 hour of video call on Botim It drained 17% of the battery. The best part is it charges in 33-35 mins depending on the number of apps on your phone. Build quality is good. Camera quality is somewhat up to the mark. While zoomimg the image pixels tear apart. Not worth 28k. Its good if the price was around 22k. Will review in detail after 2 weeks of usage. Flipkart took another 2 day extra to deliver. Bit can understand the traafic due to big billion sale.
2911,Good
2912,"This is really a master phone in this price range. I am delighted to get this . Exceptional display , battery charge is very fast , camera is wow. Processor is very responsive. No heating. Phone back cover is of premium quality. Very light weight."

2917,"Battery drain  fast, but recharge 0 to 100% quickly in 35 min , display is awesome, performance is  too good"
2918,Only cons is that the camera degrades at night other than that it is a good phone. But if you are in need of a performance centric phone and can ignore 5g then i'd suggest go for realme x7 max.

Due to attractive offer we can not refuse the order and we traped. So please don't exchange your old mobile

3204,Good deal in big billion days....Phone is light weight and performing well in terms of all aspects. Though quality can not be matched with one plus and samsung flagship phones.One can consider iQOO Z5 which is better built quality and camera compare to this phone with benefit of low price as well.
3205,Good mobile with less battery consumption. I did like front camera compare to back. But 1 disadvantage is u can't apply 120 hz refresh rate to everything especially in games... It is good mobile with the range  20000.

3655,There is some issue with the battery here.Mobile is draining battery faster than expected. Its mostly when phone is on standby. Even after disabling always on display the phone is draining 1-2 percent every hour.Realme should be able to fix this with a software update but they are lagging behind.For the last 3 years I was using realme 2 pro and never faced any problem so bought realme again (even after knowing that it has tons of bloatware) but now feeling disappointed
3656,Phone is awsome but the sound is very poor cnt hear the audio in rush area  Very disappointed

3793,Camera & battery not good .. size also small
3794,Excellent option in low budgetCons: Flipkart should improve on exchange process as the delivery guys inspect old phone like they're buying a sealed phone?Please note that it's an old phone that is being exchanged so little scratch would be there but if you investigate that with a magnifying glass then it's an issue üòî
3795,Amazing quality. Feels very premium in hand. Battery backup and camera could have been better. Worth every penny if bought in big billion sale.
3796,Excellent mobile phone
3797,It's nice phone but one drawback is its battery it should have been at least 5000 mah
3798,"Almost everything is good like display and processor and design, one thing that any buddy can notice will be a battery backup ...price should be less than 20k"

4193,Good mobile. The speed is awesome. Camera is better and not the best
4194,The worst thing after using 1 hour of video call on Botim It drained 17% of the battery. The best part is it charges in 33-35 mins depending on the number of apps on your phone. Build quality is good. Camera quality is somewhat up to the mark. While zoomimg the image pixels tear apart. Not worth 28k. Its good if the price was around 22k. Will review in detail after 2 weeks of usage. Flipkart took another 2 day extra to deliver. Bit can understand the traafic due to big billion sale.
